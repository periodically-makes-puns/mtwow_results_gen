# For mathematical formulae:
# - N = number of contestants TOTAL.
# - X = number of contestants TO BE ELIMINATED.
# - P = number of contestants PRIZING.

texture_folder: textures
# The folder where textures (backgrounds, labels, etc)

avatar_folder: books
# The folder where user books are stored.

output_folder: output
# The folder where output images are stored. Created if nonexistent.

default_avatar: default
# default_avatar is the filename (without extension) of the
# default book to be used if no custom book is present.
# Two special options exist for this option:
# - two_letter, which creates the custom book based on the two-color scheme.
# - blank, which makes all non-custom books blank.
# two_letter is the default value for this option.

results_file: results
# Where the results are located. No file extension should be given!
# The results MUST be in CSV form.

result_format:
  # Specifies how the results spreadsheet should be interpreted.
  # This is a list of all supported variables.
  # TODO: Add more variables
  - rank
  # Optional, as the program will determine this for you if left blank.
  - contestant
  # Note that this field is allowed to have duplicates.
  # Duplicate values in this field will be assumed to be extra response prizes.
  - response
  - score
  - stdev
  - skew
  - vote_count
  - vrd[10]
  # The 10 specifies the size of your voting screen, and will read
  # that number of integers in to be treated as the number of votes with that
  # particular value.
  # 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 will be interpreted as 5 100% votes and 4 0% votes.
  - hvrd[vote_count]
  # Note: It is recommend that you pass in a VRD, not a HVRD!
  # HVRDs are mostly variable length, while VRDs are always the size
  # of your voting screen, which is constant across all responses.
  # If you want to give vote data as an HVRD, you have to add a votes parameter
  # BEFORE the hvrd is specified.

sort_by: rank
# This specifies the value that the program should sort by. This determines
# the rank of the response!

sort_reverse: false
# If false, sorts ASCENDING. If true, sorts DESCENDING.

result_style: leaderboard
# The default style is leaderboard, which just generates an infobox for every
# contestant and calls it a day.
# Other valid options include:
# - 1by1s
#     Your classic 1-by-1 reveals, with descending contestants dropping to their
#     dooms! If this is specified, an x-axis and y-axis variable must be
#     specified, along with other optional values.
#     THIS METHOD MAY TAKE LONGER TO GENERATE DUE TO VIDEOS TAKING LONGER
#     THAN IMAGES TO PROCESS.
# - riskboard
#     This style uses the default style until there are 2X contestants left,
#     Then, it displays a list of contestants at risk of elimination.
#     After this point, it starts saving the topmost unrevealed contestant.
#     Options allow this to also slay the bottommost unrevealed contestant.
#     The program will automatically determine the layout of the contestants,
#     unless overridden.
# - bottoms_up
#     This style reveals in reverse, because why the **** not.
# - chaos_chaos
#     CHAOS! CHAOS! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

prize_count: 2
# Overrides max(floor(0.1N), 10) calculation.

death_count: 2
# Overrides floor(0.2N) calculation.

# These options are only for certain leaderboard styles!

# Style: leaderboard
ldrbd_options:
  generic:
    num_infoboxes: 6
    # Number of contestants to be displayed per image.
    prizer: accumulate
    # Behavior when showing the top min(5, P) contestants.
    # Default accumulates prizers until screen size reached or prizers run out.
    # e.g. First screen = 1st place, Second screen = 1st and 2nd, etc.
    # Other options:
    # - default: Treats prizers normally.
    # - 1by1: Shows them individually instead of accumulating.
    elim: 1by1
    # Behavior once elim threshold is sufficiently "close."
    # Note: Elim behavior overrides prizer behavior if the two ranges specified
    # overlap.
    # Default shows contestants 1 by 1 until the threshold is hit.
    # This begins at min(5, 0.1N) contestants left before the elim threshold.
    # Other options:
    # - batch_descending:
    #     The offset is bumped up to min(7, 0.2N) contestants.
    #     Once this is reached, the contestants will be revealled in batches of 3,
    #     then 2, then 1, until the threshold is hit.

    # If a number is specified, the number will be converted into the hex color.

    alive_bg: 0xd3c1d3
    # Which texture to use for alive contestants' backgrounds.
    dead_bg: 0xab5548
